# Write a Python program to find the position of the second occurrence of a given string in another given string. If there is no such string return -1.
# Sample Input:
# ("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", "the")
# ("the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", "the")
# Sample Output:
# -1
# 31

s = input().strip()[1:-1]
a, b = s.split('", "')

first = a.find(b)
second = a.find(b, first + 1)

print(second)
