# From Wikipedia, the free encyclopaedia:
# A happy number is defined by the following process:
# Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers.
# Write a Python program to check whether a number is "happy" or not.
# Sample Input:
# (7)
# (932)
# (6)
# Sample Output:
# True
# True
# False

n=int(input())

while n!=1 and n not in s:
    s.add(n)
    t=0
    while n>0:
        d=n%10
        t+=d*d
        n//=10
    n=t
print(n==1)
