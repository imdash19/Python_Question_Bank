# Write a Python program that accepts a list of numbers. Count the negative numbers and compute the sum of the positive numbers of the said list. Return these values through a list.
# Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Number of negative of numbers and sum of the positive numbers of the said list: [0, 15]
# Original list: [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]
# [5, 0]
# Number of negative of numbers and sum of the positive numbers of the said list: [5, 0]
# Original list: [1, 2, 3, -4, -5]
# [2, 6]
# Number of negative of numbers and sum of the positive numbers of the said list: [2, 6]
# Original list: [1, 2, -3, -4, -5]
# [3, 3]
# Number of negative of numbers and sum of the positive numbers of the said list: [3, 3]
